Gruntwork, Inc. (“Gruntwork”, “we”, “our” and/or “us”) uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website, https://gruntwork.io (“the Website”), and use the Gruntwork services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites, user interfaces, and applications (collectively, the “Services”). By using our Services, you agree to our use of cookies.

## What are cookies?

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer by your web browser. Cookies were designed to be a reliable way for websites to remember information such as your authentication status, device information such as IP address and operating system, or information previously entered into form fields such as names and addresses. <br><br> Cookies that are set directly by a website you visit are called “first-party cookies.” These are generally used to enable core functionality like authentication and session management. Cookies that are set by anyone other than the website you are visiting are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality on or through the website such as interactive content, analytics and advertising. The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.

## Why do we use cookies?

Our Services use cookies to:

- Keep track of your authentication status with our Services
